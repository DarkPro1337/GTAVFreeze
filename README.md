# GTAVFreeze - Solo public session maker
## How does it work

After you launched GTA V and logged in into GTA Online public session with players you press a **Ctrl + Alt + F** hotkey, GTAVFreeze will suspend `GTA5.exe` process, wait 10 seconds and voila! You are only one player in the public session. Then you can invite your friends to play your SecuroServ or Clubhouse missions for example!
After you pressed a hotkey for GTAVFreeze will be closed after execution to avoid suspending a process again.
Working on any GTA Online version as well.
